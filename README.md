This project is a web application that simulates a self-driving car scenario. It features a visual representation of multiple cars, including a highlighted car that demonstrates the best performance. Additionally, it displays a feed-forward neural network diagram that illustrates how the self-driving car makes decisions. Inspired by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of self-driving cars
- Visualization of the best-performing car's behavior
- Feed-forward neural network diagram for decision-making
- Option panel for customizing the simulation

## Option Panel

The application includes an option panel on the left side that allows you to configure various aspects of the simulation. Here's an explanation of the available options:

- **Pre-Trained Model**: This option allows you to load a pre-trained self-driving car model. This model has been trained beforehand and can provide a baseline for the simulation.

- **Train Model**: With this option, you can continuously load and save the current model during the simulation. This allows you to train the model yourself and observe its performance improvements. If you're not satisfied with the trained model, you can discard it and start over.

- **Vehicles**: This option lets you adjust the number and difficulty of the vehicles in the simulation. You can choose between "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" settings, which determine the number of red cars (obstacles) that will appear. Additionally, you can specify the number of blue cars (non-obstacles) that you want to include in the simulation. The default setting is 100 vehicles.
